The currency Fair will run on Google Cloud Platform using AppEngine Platform as a Service SDK. The platform runs in a secured “sandbox” environment on top of Java 6 and ensures scalability to handle additional demand. 
A high representation of the main components involved in this project is: 

•	Api RESTful Server is a stateless and high scalable dispatcher in charge of processing incoming HTTP requests and generates HTTP response with data and resources. It exposes the business logic through API endpoints to perform CRUD operations. 
•	Front-end client offers a web responsive user interface that interacts with the REST server through JSON objects. It also manages the user session since the server is stateless. 
•	Google Data Store
